		<div class="instruction_title">Creating a Control of Controls</div>

		Often times you will want to be able to combine a bunch of small controls into a larger control,
		also known as creating a <b>Composite Control</b>.  In addition to this composite control
		containing many smaller controls, the composite control would be able to define
		its own layout, as well as handling its own server- or ajax-based actions.<br/><br/>

		With a modularized set of smaller controls, layout, and events/actions, an architecture
		utilizing <b>Composite Controls</b> can see a lot of modularity and reuse for commonly
		used, more-complex interactions throughout your entire web application.<br/><br/>

		In this example, we will create a sample <b>SampleComposite</b> control, which (for lack
		of a better example) will contain a <b>QLabel</b> and two <b>QButtons</b>.  The control itself
		will contain an integer value, and the label will report what the integer value is.  The two buttons
		will be triggered by <b>QClickEvents</b> to increment or decrement that value.<br/><br/>
		
		Now, notice how even though we seem to have a lot of small controls on the page (e.g. 7 buttons, each
		with their own event handlers!), the actual form is quite simple, because we are using the
		<b>SampleComposite</b> control over and over again.

		Be sure and view the source of <b>SampleComposite.inc</b>, which of course will contain the code
		for the composite control which is doing the bulk of the work in this example.
